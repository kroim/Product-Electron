         FAQ - EN<br />

         <b>1. What is Coin Dragon?</b><br />
         The Coin Dragon kiosk counts your coins and exchanges them for real spending options.  Simply feed the dragon!  Users may convert their coins’ value into a bank account, Octopus card, charity donation, or merchant gift voucher.

         <br /></br/></br/>
         <b>2. How does it work?</b><br />
         a.  Select which output for your coins’ value:<br />
         Bank Account, Octopus card, Charity Donation, or Gift Voucher
         b.  Read and accept the ‘Terms of Use’<br />
         c.  Pour in your coins and watch the Coin Dragon count them.  Accept/reject your final count<br />
         d.  View/send your receipt<br />
         <br /></br/>
         We take care of the rest by transferring the value to you in the promised timeframe (*different for each transaction mode).<br />
         *Example: E-Wallets, and Octopus add value are immediate while bank transfers may take up to 3 working days
